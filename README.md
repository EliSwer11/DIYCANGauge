The above ui file was created in squareline studio and edited to achieve the desired functionality described in the miataturbo.net thread and/or youtube video in which this github is linked. Please read/watch the forum post/video to understand the project as a whole. The file structure, hardware, and code will be explained in detail but the ui file is posted here for ease of download. 

TO DOWNLOAD THE SQUARELINE PROJECT AND OPEN IN SQUARELINE STUDIO, DOWNLOAD BOTH THE .SPJ and .SLL FILE. The .spj file is a squareline studio project that is downloadedable and points to the .sll file for all of its components. You should be able to import the .spj into squareline and do as you wish with it as long as your .sll file is saved in the same place (i.e. downloads folder or another folder). Please read the miataTurbo forum or watch the youtube video for how to export and properly set up the file for use in arduino.
